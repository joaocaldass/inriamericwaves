* Scale analysis of nonlinear and dispersive terms in KdV equation
* Examples showing the influence of the nonlinear and the dispersive term
* Proposal of criterias for checking validity of scenarios

TODO
* Implementation of the criterias
* Tests with the gaussian wave (compare with http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/materials/   (Basics of Surface Wave Simulation - Prof. Ridgway Scott))
