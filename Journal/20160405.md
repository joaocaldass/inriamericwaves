* Discussion with Rodrigo about the discretization of the Serre equations
* Implementation of strang splitting
* Implementation of order 2 FV and FD solver

TODO
* Order 2 discretization of the FV and FD solver : finish and validate
* Discretize the second step inf the vconservative form
* Study Marche's paper on the splitting for the Green-Naghdi scheme
* Validate the Serre equations for the analytical solution with periodic BCs before moving to other BCs
