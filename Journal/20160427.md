* Discussion and correction of the TBC operator
* Implementation of the solution of the Serre equations using FVFD splitting
* Implementation of oscilatory BC's in the Serre model
* Implementation of routines with cnoidal waves solutions to the Serre equations

TODO
* Test and study small amplitude initial solution in Serre
* Test and study cnoidal wave initial condition with periodic boundaries in Serre model
* Study order of the implemented FVFD method. It may be needed to use flux limiters to increase 
order of convergence of the FV method.
* Test importance of dispersion/non-linearity with different initial conditions
