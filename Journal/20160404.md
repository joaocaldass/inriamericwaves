* Modularization of the KdV code;
* Simulation of some examples (square, sinusoidal, gaussian profiles and BBM analytical solution)
* Implementation of implicit FD scheme (not yet finished)
* Discussion about the derivation of the KdV equation (follwing BBM paper)
* Simulations with larger domain in Geoclaw (not yet finished)

TODO
* Finish FD scheme
* Finish Geoclaw simulations
* Propose a discretization for BBM ewuation
* Simulation of KdV equation zith different domains
