* NOTEBOOKS
	-  DDM_NSWE_Serre.ipynb :
		:: functions for the coupling (main routine in time, imposition of BCs, definition of fluxes for NSWE) --> DDM_nswe_serre.py
		:: Validation of the DDM NSWExNSWE
		:: DDM SerrexNSWE and NSWExSerre
	- DDM_NSWE_Serre_NonHorizontal.ipynb :
		:: exactly the same as the previous notebook, but with the computations made for h-bottom instead of h
		:: the functions are loaded from DDM_nswe_serre.py
		:: optional argument eta=d/dx(bottom)=constant is passed to the main function in time (DDM_NSWE)
