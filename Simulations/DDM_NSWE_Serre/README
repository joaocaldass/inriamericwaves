FOLDER DDM_NSWE_Serre

- Coupling of NSWE and Serre models, both with horizontal and non-horizontal bottom;

- The functions for this coupling are defined in the notebook DDM_NSWE_Serre and are stored in DDM_nswe_serre.py. The notebooks also need the module ../Serre/serreTBC.py

- Each notebook contains a validation with a coupling NSWE-NSWE. This coupling shall converge exactly and immediately to the monodomain solution

- For now, the coupling works well for the following configuration :
	-- Open external BCs
	-- Dirichlet condition imposed in two cells at the interface 
	-- 3 ghost cells in each side (requirement for the FV solver)

- The main function for performing the DDM is DDM_nswe_serre.DDM. Special attention should be given to the following parameters :
	-- fvTimesolver = serre.Euler (serre.RK4 not adapted to the imposing the IBCs)
	-- ov: size of overlapping; ov < 0 means no overlapping; otherwise, we have 1 + 2*ov overlapping cells
	-- eta : slope of the bottom
	-- dirichletIBC = True : impose Dirichlet at the interface


* NOTEBOOKS
	-  DDM_NSWE_Serre.ipynb :
		:: functions for the coupling (main routine in time, imposition of BCs, definition of fluxes for NSWE) --> DDM_nswe_serre.py
		:: Validation of the DDM NSWExNSWE
		:: DDM SerrexNSWE and NSWExSerre
	- DDM_NSWE_Serre_NonHorizontal.ipynb :
		:: exactly the same as the previous notebook, but with the computations made for h-bottom instead of h
		:: the functions are loaded from DDM_nswe_serre.py
		:: optional argument eta=d/dx(bottom)=constant is passed to the main function in time (DDM_NSWE)
