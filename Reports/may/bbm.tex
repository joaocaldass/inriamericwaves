\section{BBM equation}
\label{sec:BBM}

\subsection{The model}

\indent The second model for wave propagation that we consider in this project is the BBM equation, which models a long-wave propagation accounting for nonlinear and dispersive effects (in an alternative formulation for the KdV equation, with better stability and numerical properties). This equation is derived by \ref{BBM1971} and reads

\begin{equation}
    u_t + u_x + (u^2)_x - u_{xxt} = 0 \ , \ \ x \in [x_{min},x_{max}], \ \ t \in [0, t_{max}] \\
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discretization}

\indent The BBM model will be treated here in the same way we did for the KdV equation : we will use an split method, leading to the resolution of the following problem in each time step: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
    v_t + v_x + (v^2)_x = 0 \ \ ,\ t \in [t_n,t_{n+1}], \  v(t_n) = u(t_n) \\
    w_t - cw_{xxt} = 0 \ \ , \ t \in [t_n,t_{n+1}], \  w(t_n) = v(t_{n+1}) \\
    u(t_{n+1}) = v(t_{n+1})
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent given an initial solution and appropriate boundary conditions.

\indent The first equation (which is exactly the same as in the KdV equation) will be solved with a Finite Volume method, with a 4th order Runge-Kutta discretization for the time derivative, as described in the section \ref{sec:KdVSplitted1}.  The second equation will be solved with a Fourier spectral method in the periodic case, and a finite difference method in the nonperiodic one, as described below :

\paragraph{Periodic case}

\indent The second equation of the BBM splitted model can be written as

$$(w - cw_{xx})_t=0$$

\noindent showing that $w - w_{xx}$ does not depend on time. Therefore, for each time step $[t_n,t_{n+1}] : $

$$w - cw_{xx} = (w - cw_{xx})\rvert_{t=t_n} = (v - cv_{xx})\rvert_{t=t_{n+1}} = g(x)$$

\indent This equation will be solved using the Fourier method. Let $\hat{w}(k,t_n)$ and $\hat{g}(k)$ be the Fourier coefficients of $w(x,t_n)$ and $g(x)$ respectively.  The Fourier transform of the above equation gives

$$(\hat{w})(k,t) = \frac{\hat{g}(k)}{1+ck^2}$$

\indent The right-hand side of the last equation does not depend on time. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform using the coefficients $\hat{w}(k,t)$ gives $w(x,t_{n+1})$

\paragraph{Nonperiodic case}
