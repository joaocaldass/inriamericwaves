\section{Conclusions and next steps}

\indent Considering the work done until here and presented in this report, we can point out some further steps and problems to be solved for the continuity of the project.

\indent Concerning the study and implementation of the models for wave propagation, we will mainly focus in the Serre equations. Our first objective is to have a reliable code to its resolution, validating it to a periodic analytical solution and after moving to different types boundary conditions. We will therefore debug the numerical implementation and review the modeling. Possible increasing of the order of the schemes used may be necessary. This work is essential for the future study of Transparent Boundary Conditions applied to the Serre equations.

\indent In parallel, we will continue the study of TBCs. We will initially search in the literature the theory for the derivation of these conditions and the approximations that can be made to its numerical implementation. We will also continue proposing and optimizing approximations for the TBCs, in a similar as we did with the Robin boundary conditions.
