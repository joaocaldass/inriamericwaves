\section{Introduction}

\indent This report presents the initial work developed in the project, between March and May. It was mainly focused on the study and implementation of nonlinear dispersive models for wave propagation: the KdV, the BBM and the Serre equations. In the sections \ref{sec:KdV} to \ref{sec:Serre}, we describe each one of these models, the theoretical study realized (for example, a scale analysis for the KdV equation) and the proposed discretizations for their computational resolution, using splitting schemes combining finite volume and spectral or finite difference methods. Some examples are presented to illustrate the numerical results and show the problems that must be corrected in the schemes.

\indent Another main subject in which we worked is the study of transparent boundary conditions (TBCs). In the section \ref{sec:TBC}, we describe a first approach to it, with the study of simple approximations to the TBCs in the case of the KdV equation.
