Using a new formulation of the energy flux associated to waves modeled by the Korteweg-de Vries equation, a system of three coupled equations is derived for the determination of the local wave properties as waves propagate over gently changing depth. The system of equations is solved numerically, and the resulting shoaling curves are compared to previous results on long wave shoaling.},

The introduction contains all the possible efforts to facilitate the understanding of Fourier transform methods for which a qualitative theory is available and also some illustrative examples was given. The resulting Fourier transform maps a function defined on physical space to a function defined on the space of frequencies, whose values quantify the ¡°amount¡± of each periodic frequency contained in the original function then inverse Fourier transform reconstructs the original function from its transform.},

     abstract = {Given a set of data points in R2 and corresponding data values, it is clear that the quality of a Piecewise Linear Interpolation Surface (PLIS) over triangles depends on the specific triangulation of the data points. In this paper, the question of what are good triangles (and triangulations) for linear interpolation is studied further. First, the model problem of constructing optimal triangulations for interpolating quadratic functions by PLIS is considered. Next, a new interpretation of existing error bounds for interpolating general smooth functions by PLIS is studied. The conclusion is that triangles should be long in directions where the magnitude of the second directional derivative of F is small and thin in directions where the magnitude of the second directional derivative of F is large.},
