This manuscript proposes an  optimized SWR method for solving the
linearized KdV equation with only the dispersive term, using simple interface
operators.

While this topic is original and also fits into the scope of APNUM,
some major steps have to be undertaken before it make be accepted.

Here are my concerns.

1) It should not be an obstacle to include the advective term.
   This would be the linear KdV equation and the title would be justified.
   The whole text until (3) is already written for this linear KdV case.

2) The literature is incomplete, articles on SWR after 2008, especially
   using ABCs are missing,
   
e.g. C. Besse, F. Xing, Schwarz waveform relaxation method for one dimensional 
     Schrödinger equation with general potential, Numerical Algorithms, 74(2), 393-426, 2017 

  or the paper of    Antoine , Lorin, Bandrauk 2015

3) Discretization of BCs (7) is not consistent. Please use one-sided
 difference quotients to approximate the derivate appropriately.

4) Figure 1: Plot errors and not the solution.
   The Problem is how to select a -priorily c_R and c_L.
   it makes no sense to optimize in advance on all possible settings to find some suitable constants.

5) MAIN ISSUE which covers half the manuscript.
   the authors consider the complex cubic root of the exact TBC and "approximate" it by a constant polynomial.
   Then the constant is chosen according to minimizing the error for many choices of 
discretization parameters. This simple brute force enumeration approach is not acceptable.
E.g. changing the initial data also can lead to a different optimal constant "c".
and if starting a new calculation you cannot first "optimize" the constants.
E.g. in Ref. [1]  there are plenty of approximations to the  root operator presented.
Already a simple (1,1) Pade approximant  would yield much better accuracy and also
would not need an a-priori optimization of parameter "c" over all discretization parameters and "all" initial data, etc.
Alternatively a fast convolution approach in the spirit proposed by Ivan Sofronov may be feasible
to end up with an efficient implementation without any ambigious parameter.

Also, in exising SWR literature, e.g. Besse & Xing , absorbing BCs are used. Thus it should be
state if the art to use ABCs here.

Replacing the cubic root by a constant (even without any approximation strategy)
 has noting to do with TBCs or ABCs.


 6) Abstract : .. "based on the exact transparent boundary conditions for this equation"
    this crude approximation has not much in common with a TBC

minor issues/typos:
===================

1) citation style? please include authors name in the text, when citing their work.

2) use abbreviations DDM / IBC once they are defined

3) add domains of definition to PDEs

4) References: abbreviate Journals

   Ref [3] is already published

   typos

5) typos: page 6 "of of" at the bottom
    page 7 "analytically" , line 6 from below
   page 8 : middle "time-dependent"
                    "is (11)-(12) is"

    page 8, bottom : are referring to the Numerical Example

page 9 and 10: in the difference quotient: the factor "7 1/2" should be 7
      on page 10 one "u_N+1" should be "u_N+5"

page 9 : which "2nd order uncentered difference quotient" do you mean?

page 12  title 3.5.1. "initial data " should read ""initial time step"
