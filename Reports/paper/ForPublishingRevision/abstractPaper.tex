We propose a domain decomposition method for solving the linearized KdV equation with only the dispersive term, using a simple approximation for the exact transparent boundary conditions for this equation. An optimization process is performed for obtaining the approximation that provides the method with the fastest convergence to the solution of the monodomain problem.
