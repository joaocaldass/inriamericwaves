\section{Introduction}

\indent The Korteweg - de Vries (KdV) equation, derived by \cite{kdv1895} in 1895, models the propagation of waves with small amplitude and large wavelength, taking in account nonlinear and dispersive effects. In terms of dimensionless but unscaled variables, it can be written as \cite{BBM1971}

\begin{equation*}
	u_t + u_x + uu_x + u_{xxx} = 0
\end{equation*}

\indent As done in \cite{zheng2008} (and in \cite{besse2015} as a special case of their work), we will focus in this paper on the linearized KdV equation without the advective term : 

\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:DKdV}
	u_t  + u_{xxx} = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent to which we will refer as \emph{dispersion equation}.

\indent The work developed here is inspired from \cite{zheng2008} and \cite{besse2015}. Nevertheless, our objectives are different from theirs. In this paper we propose a domain decomposition method (DDM) for solving the dispersion equation \eqref{eq:DKdV} in a bounded domain, \emph{i.e.}, we will decompose the computational domain in subdomains and solve the problem in each one of them. Our work focuses in the formulation on appropriate and optimized conditions on the interface between the subdomains, in order to minimize the error due to the DDM and to accelerate the convergence of the method.

\indent The interface boundary conditions (IBCs) proposed here are simple approximations for the exact Transparent Boundary Conditions (TBCs) for the equation \eqref{eq:DKdV}, derived by \cite{zheng2008} and \cite{besse2015}. The TBCs make the approximate solution on the computational domain coincide with the solution of the whole domain, but its exact computation are not doable in general \cite{Xavieretal2008}. \cite{zheng2008} and \cite{besse2015} propose numerical approximations for these conditions, seeking to reduce the error created by the introduction of artificial boundaries.

\indent In the work presented here, we do not propose approximated transparent boundary conditions with the same objective (reducing the error related to the finitude of the computational domain). In fact, we intend to reduce the error created by the decomposition of the domain and the introduction of an artificial interface boundary condition, in the context of a DDM. In other words, we study the effectiveness of the boundary conditions as IBCs, not as TBCs. As a consequence, our work shall not use the same reference solution as the one used by \cite{zheng2008} and \cite{besse2015} : for validating their approaches, they compare their approximate solution with the exact solution in the whole domain. On the other hand, our reference solution will be the approximate solution computed on the computational monodomain.

\indent This paper is organized in the following way : in Section \ref{sec:TBC}, we recall the exact TBCs derived by \cite{zheng2008} for \eqref{eq:DKdV} and propose approximations for them, leading to very simple conditions (avoiding, for example, integrations in time) depending on two coefficients. With some numerical experiments, we show that these approximate TBCs work quite well (although not as well as the approaches of \cite{zheng2008} and \cite{besse2015}), motivating us to use them in the sequence of our work. In Section \ref{sec:DDM}, we describe the domain decomposition method used here and we construct it using our approximate TBCs as interface boundary conditions (IBCs). Small modifications are proposed for these IBCs such that the solution of the DDM problem converges exactly to the reference solution (the solution of the monodomain problem). Finally, we perform a large set of numerical tests in order to optimize the IBCs, in the sense that we search the coefficients for the approximate TBCs that provide the fastest convergence for the DDM iterative process.
